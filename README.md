A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and unit test in `test/`.

Didn't implement progress as ran out of time, and it looked like it required async callbacks and would have blown past the time box time.

usage run 'dart run bin/pearl.dart -o outputfile -i test/testdata'
